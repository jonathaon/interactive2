<p class="about"><face="futra">ABOUT</p>

<p class="aboutinfo"><face="futura">Although trained as an abstract painter, Roy Lichtenstein became a pioneer of Pop art famed for paintings <br>based on generic romance books and war comics. Lichtenstein transferred the clichéd comic-book <br>compositions to canvas with a projector and simplified them; the resulting paintings mimic the impersonal<br> appearance of cheap four-color printing, despite being meticulously handmade. Characteristic of this work<br> are the enlarged benday dots that would become Lichtenstein's signature mark.<br> <br>

Lichtenstein abandoned working on comics paintings by the mid-1960s, but he retained a lifelong interest in <br>the mass media. His later work often addressed how an artwork's meaning changed when it was reproduced<br> and distributed as a commercial image.</p>
